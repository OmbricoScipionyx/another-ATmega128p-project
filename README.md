# another-ATmega328p-project
A bare-metal thermometer built from scratch in C for the ATmega328P microcontroller. This project demonstrates register-level programming and custom protocol implementation by interfacing with a DHT sensor and an I2C LCD without using any Arduino libraries or external hardware abstractions.
